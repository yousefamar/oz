# Happy Birthday Aku!

This is not a 3D version of cyan.io; this is just a tribute.

## Notes:

* Make sure your browser can run [WebGL](http://webglreport.com/)!
* Give it a moment to fold out so it looks cooler.
* Hover to inspect, click to focus, drag to rotate.
* HTML in comments is rendered (XSS could be quite the problem really) but sanitisation is too much of a hassle at this stage.
* Rejoice, for one score and two years have come hither!
